<h1 id="top">Microlensing by dense gas clouds</h1>

<h2>Mark Walker&nbsp;&nbsp;&#10023;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manly Astrophysics, Australia</h2>

<p id="abstract">It is widely appreciated that cold, dense molecular gas is very difficult to detect. Modelling has demonstrated that such gas can exist in the form of spherical, self-gravitating clouds with masses in the planetary range and radii in the AU range. Microlensing studies &mdash; both Galactic and extragalactic &mdash; are one of the main ways in which such objects can be revealed, or constrained, but the task is complicated by the non-point-like nature of the lenses. I will describe the microlensing signatures that are predicted by our physical models of cloud structure &mdash; including the effects of gravitational lensing, gas lensing and extinction &mdash; and the constraints that are imposed by the available data.</p>
