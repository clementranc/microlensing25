<h1 id="top">Tomo-e Gozen and MuSCAT3: new survey and follow-up facilities in the northern hemisphere</h1>

<h2>Akihiko Fukui&nbsp;&nbsp;&#10023;&nbsp;&nbsp;The University of Tokyo, Japan</h2>

<p id="abstract">The Gaia and ZTF surveys have been discovering dozens of microlensing events per year in the Galactic
    plane, providing valuable opportunities to discover nearby lensing systems in less dense fields. However, due to the
    limited observing cadences, these survey facilities alone are not sufficient to well characterize short-timescale
    events or planetary anomalies. Here we introduce new all-sky-survey and multiband-follow-up facilities named Tomo-e
    Gozen and MuSCAT3, respectively. Tomo-e Gozen is a wide-field CMOS camera mounted on the 1.05m telescope at the Kiso
    observatory in Japan, and has been surveying the entire northern sky once to several times per night for multi
    purposes since 2019. MuSCAT3 is a four-channel imager mounted on the 2m FTN at the Haleakala observatory in Hawaii,
    and has been robotically operated by LCO since 2020. We will present some example microlensing light curves obtained
    with these new facilities to show that they are useful in filling the longitudinal gap of telescopes in the northern
    hemisphere.</p>
