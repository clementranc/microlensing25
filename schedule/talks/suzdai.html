<h1 id="top">Extinction study toward the inner milky way with Subaru HSC</h1>

<h2>Daisuke Suzuki&nbsp;&nbsp;&#10023;&nbsp;&nbsp;Osaka University, Japan</h2>

<p id="abstract">It is known that the extinction law toward the Galactic bulge (GB) is very
    different from the well-known Cardelli's standard extinction law. Most studies
    have been conducted with NIR and only a small portion of the inner GB has been
    studied with optical imaging due to the high extinction. These studies showed
    that the observed \(A_V/A_K\) is 60-80% higher than the estimate from the
    standard extinction law. To measure the intrinsic brightness of and/or distance
    to the objects toward the inner GB, it is critical to understand the amount of
    extinction that depends on the wavelengths. Also, such study will be important
    for optical precursor, concurrent and follow-up observations of the GB surveys
    such as, Roman’s RGES, JASMINE and PRIME surveys. We observed bout 30 sq. deg
    around the Galactic center to measure the optical extinction with Subaru HSC
    using g, r2, i2 and z-band filters. We measure the color and magnitude of Red
    Clump Giant in the color-magnitude-diagram of each sight line by combining
    VISTA VVV survey data. We find that the extinction toward the inner GB could be
    explained by a hybrid model of the standard and NIR extinction model. In this
    talk, we report and discuss our result.</p>
