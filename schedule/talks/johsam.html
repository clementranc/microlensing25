<h1 id="top">Predictions of the Roman Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey: Constraints on the Frequency of
    Earth-Analogs</h1>

<h2>Samson Johnson&nbsp;&nbsp;&#10023;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), CA, USA</h2>

<p id="abstract">The frequency of Earth-like planets in the habitable zone of Sun-like stars (eta-Earth) is a
    fundamental input in estimating the occurrence rate of life resembling that on Earth, and therefore an important
    parameter for designing future direct imaging missions. eta-Earth is currently best estimated by the Kepler transit
    survey, but Earth-analog systems with long periods and shallow transits are on the edge of the survey's sensitivity.
    The Roman Galactic Bulge Time Doman Survey will be able to detect Earth-analog systems through microlensing, but
    similarly they will be on the boundary of its sensitivity due to low-mass ratios and small projected separations. We
    perform simulations of the Roman Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey to estimate its ability to measure eta-Earth. We
    incorporate the Galactic Model presented by Koshimoto et al. (2021) in these simulations and we investigate the
    impact of observational cadence on Roman's sensitivity to these systems. Roman's ability to estimate eta-Earth will
    hinge on the extrapolation from systems with larger mass-ratios and wider projected separations.</p>
