<h2>Anibal Varela&nbsp;&nbsp;&#10023;&nbsp;&nbsp;Universidad de San Martín, Argentina</h2>

<p id="abstract">Neural networks, arguably the most powerful machine learning methods, are becoming commonplace in
    photometric data analysis. This presentation will provide a (hopefully) intuitive understanding of neural networks,
    including an insight into what they learn, how they learn it, and, importantly, why they often fail to do what we
    expect them to do. Neural networks are particularly valuable in areas with large quantities of data; As data
    collection rates continue to increase, the nearly limitless capabilities of neural networks are sure to play an
    increasingly larger role in future works. The goal of this presentation is that you walk away with the ability to
    see where neural networks may be valuable in your own work and to conceptually understand how neural networks are
    being used by others.</p>
