<h1 id="top">A joint analysis of ground-based and space-based data for a short event K2C9-2016-BLG-1</h1>

<h2>Radosław Poleski&nbsp;&nbsp;&#10023;&nbsp;&nbsp;Astronomical Observatory of the University of Warsaw, Poland</h2>

<p id="abstract">Studies of free-floating planets (FFPs) are one of the main focus of microlensing research nowadays. In
    order to estimate the masses of the FFPs, we would need to measure their microlensing parallaxes either by detecting
    subtle changes in the light curves caused by different locations of observatories on the Earth or by observing the
    event from the ground and from space. Such measurements have not yet been done. In order to measure the microlensing
    parallax of FFPs, a microlensing campaign was conducted by the K2 space mission. A recent analysis of the K2 bulge
    data by McDonald et al. (2021) revealed four candidates for FFPs. We searched ground-based archival datasets for
    microlensing signals and detected such a signal only for one of them: K2C9-2016-BLG-1 in the KMTNet data. I will
    present a joint analysis of K2C9 and KMTNet data for this event.</p>
