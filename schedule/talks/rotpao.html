<h1 id="top">Xallarap as a contaminant in planetary microlensing</h1>

<h2>Paolo Rota&nbsp;&nbsp;&#10023;&nbsp;&nbsp;Università degli Studi di Salerno, Italy</h2>

<p id="abstract">MOA-2006-BLG-074 was selected as one of the most promising planetary candidates in a retrospective
    analysis of the MOA collaboration: its asymmetric high-magnification peak can be perfectly explained by a source
    passing across a central caustic deformed by a small planet. However, after a detailed analysis of the residuals, we
    have realized that a single lens and a source orbiting with a faint companion provides a more satisfactory
    explanation for all the observed deviations from a Paczynski curve and the only physically acceptable
    interpretation. Indeed the orbital motion of the source is constrained enough to allow a very good characterization
    of the binary source from the microlensing light curve. The case of MOA-2006-BLG-074 suggests that the so-called
    xallarap effect must be taken seriously in any attempts to obtain accurate planetary demographics from microlensing
    surveys.</p>
