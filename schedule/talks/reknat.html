<h1 id="top">High angular resolution images yield a mass measurement of OGLE-2013-BLG-0132</h1>

<h2>Natalia Rektsini&nbsp;&nbsp;&#10023;&nbsp;&nbsp;University of Tasmania, Australia</h2>

<p id="abstract">The event OGLE-2013-BLG-0132 was discovered by the OGLE Early Warning System on 2013 March 3. The event was also independently found by the MOA collaboration (as MOA-2013-BLG-148) on 2013 March 13. The anomaly observed in the light curve of the event was caused by a caustic-crossing. This caustic-crossing lasted almost \(\sim 24\) hours and was covered by both photometric surveys. The photometric observations enabled a precise measurement of the planet-to-host mass ratio (\(5.15\cdot10^{-4} \pm 0.28\cdot10^{-4}\)) as well as the dimensionless lens-source projected separation (\(1.150 \pm 0.004\)) as reported in Mroz et al. (2017). More precisely, Mroz et al. show that the planetary anomaly was caused the source crossing a wide separation caustic. Meanwhile, due to the fact that the event was too short (\(t_\mathrm{E}\sim 30\) days) and faint, a reliable measurement of the microlens parallax is not possible, leaving the lens absolute mass unknown at the time.

<br><br>I will present the preliminary results obtained from the combination of high angular resolution images with the light curve model parameters. In order to achieve that I am using Keck OSIRIS high angular resolution adaptive optics follow up observations of the event, performed on July 2020, almost 7.5 years after the discovery of the planetary anomaly, where we can see that the source and the lens are almost resolved. These data yield a measurement of the lens-source relative proper motion as well as the flux ratio between the lens and the source. In addition to that, I use photometric observations of OGLE I and V band data as well as MOA R and V band data, which are recently reduced by an improved and optimised pipeline for MOA data. This method can restrict the range of solutions provided by the microlensing light curve, confirm the light-curve model, and finally provide a measurement of the host star mass, the planet's mass and the distance to the planetary system.

<br><br>The high angular resolution observations, as well as this study, are performed in the context of the programme measuring the mass of most of microlensing planets detected so far (PI: Bennett), by using the primary mass measurement method that will be employed by the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.</p>
