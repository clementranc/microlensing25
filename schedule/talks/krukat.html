<h1 id="top">Microlensing event highlights in Gaia Science Alerts</h1>

<h2>Katarzyna Kruszyńska&nbsp;&nbsp;&#10023;&nbsp;&nbsp;Astronomical Observatory, University of Warsaw, Poland</h2>

<p id="abstract">On the 19th of December 2013 Gaia Space Satellite was launched by European Space Agency. Its main goal is to measure proper motions and parallaxes of over 1 billion stars in Milky Way. However, ever since the first data has been acquired in 2014, Gaia has observed much more than that.

<br><br>Up to this day its alerting system of sudden change in brightness of observed sources AlertPipe has detected around 18,000 transients.

<br><br>More than 300 of them have been classified as microlensing candidates from all over the sky, with Gaia16aye, Gaia18cbf, Gaia19bld, Gaia19dke and Gaia20fnr as spectacular examples among them.</p>
