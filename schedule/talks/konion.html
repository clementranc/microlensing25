<h1 id="top">Prediction of the Planet Detection Rates by the PRIME Microlensing Survey</h1>

<h2>Iona Kondo&nbsp;&nbsp;&#10023;&nbsp;&nbsp;Osaka University, Japan</h2>

<p id="abstract">The PRime-focus Infrared Microlensing Experiment (PRIME) will start a NIR microlensing survey in the
    Galactic Center, which cannot be seen by conventional visible observation due to the high dust extinction. The main
    purpose of PRIME is to reveal the demography of low-mass planets outside the snow-line and the planet frequency in
    the Galactic Center.<br><br>

    PRIME will conduct a H-band high-cadence wide field of view (FOV) survey using a 1.8m telescope (f/2.29) with 1.45
    deg\(^2\) (0.5''/pix) NIR camera to be installed at South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO) in Sutherland.<br><br>

    Here, we investigate the expected number and characteristics of the detected planets depending on various
    observation strategies. In order to maximize the number of planet detections, we optimize the observation field and
    the cadence between which there are trade-offs.<br><br>

    We estimate the detection efficiency of the primary events and planetary signals following the procedure bellow: (i)
    randomly simulate microlensing events toward different directions in the Galactic bulge based on the Galactic model
    (Koshimoto+2021), (ii) generate synthetic data points based on the observation condition and strategy of PRIME,
    (iii) exert detectability criteria to these simulated events. Finally, we calculate the statistics and planet yields
    for each observation strategy. In this talk, we will present the current results of our simulation and discuss the
    optimal survey strategies and predicted planet yields by the PRIME microlensing survey. We will also discuss the
    effect of changing the Koshimoto+2021 Galactic model to the Besançon Galactic Model (Robin+2003).</p>
