<h1 id="top">Modeling approaches for planetary events, the cases of
                            OGLE-2018-BLG-0677 and KMT-2021-BLG-0919</h1>

<h2>Antonio Herrera Martin&nbsp;&nbsp;&#10023;&nbsp;&nbsp;University of Toronto, Canada</h2>

<p id="abstract">Microlensing is a very effective method for detecting extrasolar planets. Lightcurves models describe these events, and they are used to study them. Here I present a description of how a Bayesian analysis uses these parameters in combination with a galactic model to obtain the physical description of the lens. In particular, a comparison in the approach used by the event OGLE-2018-BLG-0677 and KMT-2021-BLG-0919.

OGLE-2018-BLG-0677 was an event observed in 2018 by the KMTnet and OGLE telescopes. It presented a small dip that encouraged the presence of a binary lens. It presented a particular degeneracy, where two possible solutions are extremely close in the parameter space, and only the geometry of the lens plane is different. Due to its short duration, it is not possible to detect parallax, and only the crossing time and a finite effect provided the information for the galactic model. The analysis resulted in a super-Earth orbiting a brown dwarf with an average distance similar to the sun and venus. In comparison, KMT-2021-BLG-0919  was observed in 2021 by KMTnet. Given the duration, it was possible to obtain a parallax, and we compared the same galactic modeling approach as for OGLE-2018-BLG-0677, but contrasted with the case of a galactic prior for the lightcurve parameters to obtain direct feedback during the lightcurve modeling, also including an error renormalization as free parameters during the modeling process and information from the Gaia catalog with information of the source.</p>
