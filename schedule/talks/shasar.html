<h1 id="top">Analysis of Gravitational Microlensing Event: OGLE-2018-BLG-0380</h1>

<h2>Sarang Shah&nbsp;&nbsp;&#10023;&nbsp;&nbsp;India Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT), India</h2>

<p id="abstract">We present the analysis of the microlensing event OGLE-2018-BLG-0380, that was
observed towards the galactic bulge in the microlensing season of 2018. The
light curve of this event had two prominent peaks and a third bump towards the
decreasing side of the light curve. The conventional method of grid search
failed to give any solutions that can explain the light curve. So, we performed
a heuristic analysis of the light curve and found that the binary lens orbital
motion explains the third perturbation. This is the highest orbital motion ever
detected in a microlensing event. Since the event has \(t_\mathsf{E}\sim9\) days, we did not
detect orbital parallax. We also investigated the occurrence of the event by
binary lens and binary source. However, the binary lens and single-lens model
is preferred by a significant probability. The
Bayesian analysis of the galactic model priors that is constrained by the
measured angular motion prefers the bulge location of the lens system by 91%.
We find that the lens is comprised of an brown dwarf at the deuterium burning
limit orbiting a M-dwarf mass host in the galactic bulge. The median projected
separation between them is 0.85 AU. It is also found that the median value of
(K.E./P.E.)\(_\perp\)= 0.91 which indicates a face-on system.</p>
